# ft_linear_regression

The aim of this project is to implement a basic concept of machine learning.

For this project, we will create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
Formula: estimatedPrice(mileage) = θ0 + (θ1 ∗ mileage)

The use of numpy.polyfit is forbidden. 

To run the price prediction program:
> python basic_car_price_prediction.py

To run machine learning program:
> python training_program_numpy.py

Replace python by your current alias.
